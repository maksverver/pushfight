r4.bin input is incorrect

Detected by Dylan during phase 5.

perm: 131851620602
pred: 101294775009  (pred is marked LOSS but 'perm' is not marked WIN!)

Dylan reported: failing input chunks are 2439 and 2505.

That means not all losses were propagated correctly!
Predecessor is from chunk 1873.

Chunk 1873 was marked completed in r4-wins.bin, but forcing a rerun found some
more wins. Not sure how that's possible (data loss on system restart?)

Resolution:
I forced a rerun (./backpropgate-losses 4 1873 1874, commenting out the check
for chunks that are already done), regenerated r4-bin, and restarted phase 5.

Note: restarting might not have fixed all problems, since existing output files
for phase 5 would have been re-uploaded even if they contained incorrect data!
If true, there might be some losses that were not identified in phase 5. These
would have been detected in phase 7 instead.

According to the server logs, this might apply to chunks up 3053!
