r4.bin input is incorrect

Detected by Dylan during phase 5.

perm: 131851620602
pred: 101294775009  (pred is marked LOSS but 'perm' is not marked WIN!)

Dylan reported: failing input chunks are 2439 and 2505.

That means not all losses were propagated correctly!
Predecessor is from chunk 1873.

Chunk 1873 was marked completed in r4-wins.bin, but forcing a rerun found some
more wins. Not sure how that's possible (data loss on system restart?)

Resolution:
I forced a rerun (./backpropgate-losses 4 1873 1874, commenting out the check
for chunks that are already done), regenerated r4-bin, and restarted phase 5.
