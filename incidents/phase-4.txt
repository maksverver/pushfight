r4.bin input is incorrect

Detected by Dylan during phase 5.

perm: 131851620602
pred: 101294775009  (pred is marked LOSS but 'perm' is not marked WIN!)

Dylan reported: failing input chunks are 2439 and 2505.

That means not all losses were propagated correctly!
Predecessor is from chunk 1873.

Chunk 1873 was marked completed in r4-wins.bin, but forcing a rerun found some
more wins. Not sure how that's possible (data loss on system restart?)

Resolution:
I forced a rerun (./backpropgate-losses 4 1873 1874, commenting out the check
for chunks that are already done), regenerated r4-bin, and restarted phase 5.

Note: restarting might not have fixed all problems, since existing output files
for phase 5 would have been re-uploaded even if they contained incorrect data!
If true, there might be some losses that were not identified in phase 5. These
would have been detected in phase 7 instead.

According to the server logs, this might apply to chunks up 3053!

Resolution (part 2):
I recalculated all phase 5 output chunks up to 3053 using solve-rN,
to find the incorrect chunks. It turns out there were only three:

    chunk-r5-0591.bin
    chunk-r5-0660.bin
    chunk-r5-2168.bin

I used solve2 to recomputed losses and backpropagated wins, and then ran
integrate-two to update r5.bin and r6.bin. It turns out there were a total of
35 new losses, and 0 new wins:

output/chunk-r6-0591-two.bin: 356561 losses, 20 new losses.
output/chunk-r6-0591-two.bin: 596474 wins, 0 new wins.
output/chunk-r6-0660-two.bin: 262372 losses, 8 new losses.
output/chunk-r6-0660-two.bin: 12143 wins, 0 new wins.
output/chunk-r6-2168-two.bin: 466711 losses, 7 new losses.
output/chunk-r6-2168-two.bin: 0 wins, 0 new wins.
Total 1694261 permutations, 1085644 losses, 35 new losses, 608617 wins, 0 new wins.

I also used `integrate-two --dry-run` to confirm that r7.bin contained the
losses already, as expected.
